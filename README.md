## Summary
*The Luira Project* is an epic fantasy novel that alternates between two main characters—Kyira, a twelve-year-old human princess, and Falupine, a young magical creature known as an Anperil—whose fates are intertwined by prophecy, magic, and political upheaval in the land of Luira.

The story begins with Kyira preparing for her baptism ceremony, an important political and spiritual rite that marks her official entry into royal training. As tensions rise in the kingdom due to civil unrest and growing opposition against her father, King Sorin, Kyira becomes increasingly aware of the dangers surrounding her. She has magical abilities that allow her to sense emotions and vibrations through sound and touch, which amplifies her awareness of the looming rebellion. During her baptism, an assassin attempts to kill her, and the palace descends into chaos. Her parents, fearing for her life, arrange for her to be secretly evacuated from the city.

Meanwhile, Falupine, an adolescent Anperil with a dangerous magical bond to a powerful ancient spirit named Fhyrinan, lives in a hidden village deep in the forest. He struggles with controlling his powers, which flare up uncontrollably during a hunting trip. Shortly after, a mysterious Anperil known as the White Anperil arrives in the village with Kyira, who was rescued from near death after the failed assassination. She reveals that Kyira is Falupine’s fated “Bond,” a human marked to one day wield great magical power and share a mystical connection with an Anperil protector.

Due to their youth, the two are not yet ready to fulfill their shared destiny, so the White Anperil magically seals Kyira’s powers and sends her to a remote island to grow up in safety. Falupine is left behind, now burdened with the knowledge of their linked futures.
